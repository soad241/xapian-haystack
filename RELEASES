xapian-haystack-UNRELEASED
==========================

Tagged on ??, 2010 by David Sauve <dsauve@trapeze.com>

Code Changes
------------
* Updated SearchBackend.update to be smarter when indexing multi-value fields and stemming. It will now only stem text fields and will properly index each field of a MultiValueField.
* MultiValueFields will no longer store data in the value column of the index.
* Faceted fields will now be automatically duplicated internally.  This corresponds to Haystack, SHA c8f8d, http://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack/commit/c8f8dcc2d79a9dcb67deefdc031629655b874820
* `__startswith` filter has been improved to work more effeciently.
* `SearchResults` obey the type of data chosen in their corresponding field in the `SearchIndex` if present.
* Changed `SearchBackend.update` method to index terms with punctuation as well as using the Xapian.TermGenerator.
* Fixed another occurrence of DatabaseModifiedError
* Updated for compatibility with Xapian 1.2 by removing deprecated method calls and slightly refactoring the way queries are constructed.
* SearchQuery._term_query will now properly build a query for field `id` and `django_ct` fields.

Known Issues
------------
* `SearchBackend.search` with `highlight=True` converts terms to lowercase in result content.
* SearchQuery doesn't handle multiple exclude attributes correctly
